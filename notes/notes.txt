main
- arg[0] without the directory, without the extension, split by first -
  ./cfn-init = [cfn, init]
  C:\cfn\cfn-get-metadata.exe = [cfn, get-metadata]
  cfn = [cfn]

thus,
- main handles cfn (rarely called, but explains subcommands)
- cmd/init.go handles cfn-init

cfn has global options (common sets that subcommands use?), incl
- stack
- resource
- url (endpoint)
- region
- credential-file
- role
- access-key
- secret-key
- http-proxy
- https-proxy

commands
- init
- signal
- get-metadata
- hup *** does not accept global options
